00 00 00 00    tests the base case
00 00 00 80    bit 8 of the 4th byte is 1. Little endian value will be negative and also the lowest possible int value with 32 bits
00 00 80 00    bit 8 of the 3rd byte is 1.
00 80 00 00    bit 8 of the 2nd byte is 1. Little endian and big endian values should be opposite of the test above
80 00 00 00    bit 8 of the 1st byte is 1. Big endian value will be negative and also the lowest possible int value
8f ff ff 8f    byte 1 = byte 4. byte 2 = byte 3. Little and big endian values should be equal
ff ff ff 00    big endian value will be negative and little endian value will be positive
ff ff ff ff    largest possible hex number with 4 bytes. Little endian and big endian should both equal -1
7F FF FF FF    Big endian should equal 2147483647, the largest possible int value with 32 bits
80 00 00 00    big endian will equal to the smallest possible int value with 32 bits
