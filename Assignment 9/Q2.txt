We can see that the read times for aRead are significantly faster than those of sRead.
Small numbers of disk reads are faster for aRead, and large number of disk reads are
much faster. The reason for this is quite simple: sRead waits for each block to
be read and aRead does not. aRead can process multiple requests in parallel, therefore
it does not follow the linear trend of (number of reads) * 10ms.
