Since sRead schedules the read then waits for its completion, we can see that 
the real times are linearly proportional to the number of reads. Since a read 
takes 10ms on our simulated disk, the expected time for 10 reads is 
10ms * 10 or 0.1s. The actual time it took was 0.114s, which is a very close value. 
Similarly, 100 reads should take 1s and 1000 reads should take 10s. Our actual 
values are very close to the expected values of (number of reads) * 10ms.
