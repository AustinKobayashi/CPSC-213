We can see that the read times for tRead are significantly faster than those of sRead, similar to
aRead. tRead is slightly slower than aRead, but still quite close in terms of speed. A good explanation for 
this can be found when we examine the system times. tRead has much longer system times than aRead does,
meaning that tRead spends more time running in the operating system. This is caused by the overhead of 
many threads, and these threads are the reason why tRead is slightly slower than aRead, but still faster
than sRead due to parallelism.
